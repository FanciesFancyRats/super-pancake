string allow index s[n] will also take negative values starting at the end
slicing [start:stop], [start:stop:step]
if you leave spaces empty 
strings are immutable and cannot be modified
s = "hello"
s[0] = 'y' will give a syntax error
to perform that action you can use the workaround:
s = 'y'+s[1:len(s)]
